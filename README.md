# BYTEUPRISE_SD_02

Excited to share a project I completed during my software development internship at ByteUprise! ğŸš€

I built a **Contact Management System** using Python and Tkinter, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience in several key areas:

ğŸ”¹ **GUI Development:** Designed a user-friendly interface with Tkinter, enhancing my skills in creating intuitive and responsive applications.

ğŸ”¹ **Database Management:** Implemented an SQLite database for persistent storage, learning how to efficiently manage and interact with data.

ğŸ”¹ **CRUD Operations:** Developed functionalities to Create, Read, Update, and Delete contacts, reinforcing my understanding of these fundamental operations.

ğŸ”¹ **Error Handling:** Improved my ability to handle exceptions and ensure a smooth user experience, even in case of errors.

ğŸ”¹ **Modular Programming:** Organized code into separate modules for better maintainability and scalability.
